# healthcheck

Personal collection of checks that I use to monitor my externally reachable services. Results of those checks are 
submitted to [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) so I get bombarded with alerts even when my whole network
goes down. I wholeheartedly recommend them, awesome to use and they have a free plan.
